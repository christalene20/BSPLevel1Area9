              materials are the most



              vital necessities in order to


              work in the laboratory.



              The quality of the



              equipment and



              availability of the supplies



              and materials should be


              maintained in order to



              obtain valuable and



              promising results from



              the experiments.  The



              equipment, supplies and


              materials in the laboratory



              are maintained through



              the following practices:]]></page><page Index="62"><![CDATA[•             Every beginning of the



         semester, the students



         were introduced with the



         basic uses and functions of



         various laboratory tools,



         apparatuses and



         equipment.  Hands-on



         training and practical



         exams are also conducted



         during laboratory sessions



         under the supervision of



         the faculty.]]></page><page Index="63"><![CDATA[•             Each laboratory



         equipment has its own log



         sheet which registers the



         name of the user, time and



         date of usage, supervising



         personnel and the user’s



         signature. It allows



         monitoring of the use of



         the equipment,



         troubleshooting of the



         possible occurring



         problems and tracing of



         the person responsible for


         the possible occurring




         problems.]]></page><page Index="64"><![CDATA[•             Acquisition of chemicals



         available on the chemical


         room is also recorded in log



         sheets.  The log sheet records


         the name of the user, time and


         date of acquisition, amount of



         chemical acquired, supervising


         personnel and the user’s


         signature.  This allows



         monitoring the amount of


         chemicals and estimating its


         availability on its succeeding



         usage.  This allows the


         laboratory technician to


         prepare the purchase request



         for the chemicals with


         depleting amount beforehand.]]></page><page Index="65"><![CDATA[•             Reservation on the use of


         laboratory equipment and tools



         is implemented among students


         to impose discipline.  This also


         allows the laboratory technician


         t prepare and estimate the


         materials available beforehand.



         In case of scarcity, the


         technician prioritizes and


         provides alternatives.






         •             The number and



         availability laboratory supplies,


         equipment and materials are


         frequently subjected to


         inventory for estimating the


         specific number of pieces



         needed for purchase request.]]></page><page Index="66"><![CDATA[•             The faculty always



         coordinate with the



         laboratory technician to



         monitor the materials


         necessary for the upcoming



         conductions of



         experiments.








         •             A stock of accessories


         for certain laboratory



         equipment is available



         under the supervision of



         the laboratory technician.]]></page><page Index="67"><![CDATA[•             Demonstrations of


         different brands of



         laboratory equipment from



         different suppliers are


         always conducted within the



         laboratory premises.  This



         allows the laboratory
