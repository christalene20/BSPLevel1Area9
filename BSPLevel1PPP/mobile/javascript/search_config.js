The quality of the                  equipment and                  availability of the supplies                  and materials should be                 maintained in order to                  obtain valuable and                  promising results from                  the experiments.  The                  equipment, supplies and                 materials in the laboratory                  are maintained through                  the following practices:","•             Every beginning of the             semester, the students             were introduced with the             basic uses and functions of             various laboratory tools,             apparatuses and             equipment.  Hands-on             training and practical             exams are also conducted             during laboratory sessions             under the supervision of             the faculty.","•             Each laboratory             equipment has its own log             sheet which registers the             name of the user, time and             date of usage, supervising             personnel and the user’s             signature. It allows             monitoring of the use of             the equipment,             troubleshooting of the             possible occurring             problems and tracing of             the person responsible for            the possible occurring              problems.","•             Acquisition of chemicals             available on the chemical            room is also recorded in log             sheets.

This allows             monitoring the amount of            chemicals and estimating its            availability on its succeeding             usage.  This allows the            laboratory technician to            prepare the purchase request             for the chemicals with            depleting amount beforehand.","•             Reservation on the use of            laboratory equipment and tools             is implemented among students            to impose discipline.  This also            allows the laboratory technician            t prepare and estimate the            materials available beforehand.
